### Overview
In 1985, the NCAA expanded their Division I basketball tounament to a 64 team single elimination tournament. Since that time there have been 2117 games (including some play in games).I have been following the NCAA Division I Basketball tournament for about 15 years. During that time, I have been trying to analyze any possible statistical trends in order to better predict and create a winning bracket. 


In this project I will analyze one more aspect.  


### All Games

```{r}
datatable(Allgames, extensions = "Responsive",options=list(lengthMenu = c(10,25,68)))
```

### Seed History

Some interesting trends have occured in the past 33 years.

* A number 5 seed has never won a chapionship even though a 6, 7, and 8 seed have. 

* The 10, 11, and 12 seeds have faired much better than the 9 seeds.

* No 16 seed has ever beaten a 1 seed.

* The number 1 seeds have collected the majority of the championships.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
Allgames$Round<-factor(Allgames$Round, levels=c("Play-in", "64", "32","16","8","4","Champ"))
SH<-table(Allgames$wSeed,Allgames$Round)
rownames(SH)<-c("Seed 1","Seed 2","Seed 3","Seed 4","Seed 5","Seed 6","Seed 7","Seed 8","Seed 9","Seed 10","Seed 11","Seed 12","Seed 13","Seed 14","Seed 15","Seed 16")
pander(SH)
```

### Upsets

In 33 seasons of the NCAA Basketball tournament, there have been 296 upsets (at least a 3 seed differential).


```{r}
upsets<-subset(AGTCCS, SeD>=4)
pander(sort(table(upsets$Upset)),decreasing=TRUE)
pander(count(upsets$Upset))

pander(table(upsets$WConf))
```
